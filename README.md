This project implements bluetooth communication to the BBC Microbit https://microbit.org/. The magnetometer, accelerometer, button state and an LED of the BBC Microbit can be accesed from a phone/computer using bluetooth with this code.

The LED display is also used to display an arrow indicating the current direction the BBC Microbit is facing using it's accelerometer readings. 
A video detailing the background into the code and the project can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4415Yln1s4&t=558s
